# Profile Feature
A different branch was created for the profile feature due to bugs. Look at the profile branch for more details.

# Ticket Master Dev
The development that I put into the ticketMaster implementation is in a separate branch called ticketMaster. I ran into many issues when dealing with the JSON object that is sent back from the Ticket Master API.
